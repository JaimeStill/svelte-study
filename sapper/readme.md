**What is Sapper?**

There are two basic concepts:
* Each page in your app is a Svelte component.
* You create pages by adding files to the `src/routes` directory of your project. These will be server-rendered so that a user's first visit to your app is as fast as possible, then a client-side app takes over.

Building an app with all the modern best practices - code-splitting, offline support, server-rendered views with client-side hydration - is fiendishly complicated. Sapper does all the boring stuff for you so that you can get on with the creative part.

**Getting started**  

The easisest way to start building a Sapper app is to clone the [sapper-template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template) repo with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit "sveltejs/sapper-template#rollup" my-app
# or: npx degit "sveltejs/sapper-template#webpack" my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will scaffold a new project in the `my-app` directory, install its dependencies, and start a server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Try editing the files to get a feel for how everything works.
