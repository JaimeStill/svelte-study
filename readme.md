# Svelte Study

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the *browser*, Svelte shifts that work into a *compile step* that happens when you build your app.

[Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.

Unlike single-page apps, Sapper doesn't compromise on SEO, progressive enhancement or the initial load experience - but unlike traditional server-rendered apps, navigation is instantaneous for that app-like feel.
