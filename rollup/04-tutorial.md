## Creating Your First Bundle
[Back to Top](#tutorial)

*Before we begin, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed so that you can use [NPM](https://npmjs.com/). You'll also need to know how to access the [command line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) on your machine.*

The easiest way to use Rollup is via the Command Line Interface (or CLI). For now, we'll install it globally (later on we'll learn how to install it locally to your project so that your build process is portable, but don't worry about that yet). Type this into the command line:

```bash
npm install rollup --global
# or `npm i rollup -g` for short
```
